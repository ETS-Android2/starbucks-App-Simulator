 The team members decided to meet in college to put together our thoughts about the group project. We went through the group project requirements. We individually shared our ideas on the 5 APIs to be implemented as a part of the individual portion, and for extra credits we would create an android app and deploy API to AWS in an Auto Scaled EC2 Cluster with Load Balancer.

# Feedback 2 : 05/05/2019
We had a conference call where Nihal suggesetd that we  could implement the REST APIs and demo the components through an android mobile app. Since Nihal was comfortable with java development on android, the team agrees to this suggestion. The team decided that they would collaborate with Nihal for their individual API's and Nihal would intergrate them into the android mobile app

# Feedback 3 : 05/06/2019
During the daily call on 05/06/, Jessica and Nihal suggested that the REST APIs be implemented using PHP. Amit, Pooja and Prathamesh said that since they had worked on node js and react js, they were comfortable implementing the REST APIs on react js using postman. So it was decided that AMit, Pooja and Prathamesh will implement the REST APIs using react.js and use a POST API to push the card details, payment details, order details etc into the Mongo DB

# Feedback 4 : 05/07/2019
Prathamesh gave us the feedback that we start with creating the wireframes for the android mobile app. Nihal put forth the idea of starting the design of the mobile application frontend. As a feedback from, Amit and Pooja suggested to host the server application on AWS and confirm if application is working on each part to ensure early bug fixing if any.

# Feedback 5 : 05/08/2019
Nihal and Pooja were facing issues in the Add Cards API where the API was not working when the user tried to insert the same card again. As a feedback we suggested few changes in API calls to ensure the other team  doesn't face the same issue.

# Feedback 6 : 05/09/2019
Issues and bug fixing reporting: We discussed and everybody took its as feedback that we should integrate as early to ensure early bug fixing.
