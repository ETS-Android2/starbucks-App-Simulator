When the team members met up, we decided that since there was no time, we would keep the project simple and only implement what is asked of us. Initially there were thoughts of doing more than 2 tasks for extra credits but the team zeroed in on deploying APIs on the cloud and a mobile app.


# Simplicity 2 : 05/05/2019
We had a conference call where Nihal suggesetd that we  could implement the REST APIs and demo the components through an android mobile app. Since Nihal was comfortable with java development on android, the team agrees to this suggestion. The team decided that they would collaborate with Nihal for their individual API's and Nihal would intergrate them into the android mobile app


# Simplicity 3 : 05/06/2019
During the daily call on 05/06/, Jessica and Nihal suggested that the REST APIs be implemented using PHP. Amit, Pooja and Prathamesh said that since they had worked on node js and react js, they were comfortable implementing the REST APIs on react js using postman. So it was decided that AMit, Pooja and Prathamesh will implement the REST APIs using react.js and use a POST API to push the card details, payment details, order details etc into the Mongo DB

# Simplicity 4 : 05/07/2019
During the team meeting, Prathamesh suggested that we start with creating the wireframes for the android mobile app. Nihal put forth the idea of starting the design of the mobile application frontend. Amit and Pooja gave ideas on how to host the server application on AWS.

# Simplicity 5 : 05/08/2019
The team reported on the progress of the individual API's. Nihal and Pooja were facing issues in the Add Cards API where the API was not working when the user tried to insert the same card again. Jessica mentioned that she created a list of orders and Amit mentioned that he is working on deploying the apk file on AWS cloud

# Simplicity 6 : 05/09/2019
Issues and bug fixing reporting: Each API owner worked on their part and discussed on open issues and bugs. For example: Reported  bug of multiple entries for the same userid were allowed  by the first alogorithm. This has been fixed.

# Simplicity 7 : 05/10/2019
Issue and bug fixing continued: Reported bugs are resolved by each API owner and we worked by sitting in college to ensure proper communication.
Integration of distinct API is also done to ensure smooth deliverables.We also decided on demo part and integration of documents in github.
