# Communication 1 : 05/04/2019
Since constant communication is the key to any successful project, all the team members decided to meet in college to put together our thoughts about the group project. We went through the group project requirements and decided that we would be implementing 5 APIs as a part of the individual portion, and for extra credits we would create an android app and deploy API to AWS in an Auto Scaled EC2 Cluster with Load Balancer for extra credit

# Communication 2 : 05/05/2019
We had a conference call where Nihal suggesetd that we  could implement the REST APIs and demo the components through an android mobile app. Since Nihal was comfortable with java development on android, the team agrees to this suggestion. The team decided that they would collaborate with Nihal for their individual API's and Nihal would intergrate them into the android mobile app

# Communication 3 : 05/06/2019
During the daily call on 05/06/2019, Jessica and Nihal suggested that the REST APIs be implemented using PHP. Amit, Pooja and Prathamesh said that since they had worked on node js, they were comfortable implementing the REST APIs on node js using postman. So it was decided that AMit, Pooja and Prathamesh will implement the REST APIs using nodejs and use a POST API to push the card details, payment details, order details etc into the Mongo DB

# Communication 4 : 05/07/2019
During the call Prathamesh suggested that we start with creating the wireframes for the android mobile app. Nihal put forth the idea of starting the design of the mobile application frontend. Amit and Pooja gave ideas on how to host the server application on AWS.

# Communication 5 : 05/08/2019
The team reported on the progress of the individual API's. Nihal started creating an API for user authentication. Pooja was facing issues in the Add Cards API where the API was not working when the user tried to insert the same card again. Jessica mentioned that she created an API for Paymentsand Amit mentioned that he is working on the API for managed orders and deploying the apk file on AWS cloud. Prathamesh told that he was working on the API for reset pin.

# Communication 6 : 05/09/2019
Issues and bug fixing reporting: Each API owner worked on their part and discussed on open issues and bugs. For example: Reported  bug of multiple entries for the same userid were allowed  by the first alogorithm. This has been fixed.

# Communication 7 : 05/10/2019
Issue and bug fixing continued: Reported bugs are resolved by each API owner and we worked by sitting in college to ensure proper communication.
Integration of distinct API is also done to ensure smooth deliverables.We also decided on demo part and integration of documents in github.
