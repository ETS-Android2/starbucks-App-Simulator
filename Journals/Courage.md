Since the group project was due in a week, all of us as a team were nervous about completing the entire project in a week. Nihal booted us up giving us confidence that it can be done. Once we started discussing, ideas started flowing through and we realized this task is doable

# Courage 2 : 05/05/2019
It is day 2 and we have just started with the implementation of the individual portions. The team agreed to a bold move of showcasing the working of APIs through a mobile android app and researching more about deploying APIs on AWS cloud.


# Courage 3 : 05/06/2019
During the daily call on 05/06/, Jessica and Nihal suggested that the REST APIs be implemented using PHP. Amit, Pooja and Prathamesh said that since they had worked on node js . Since the data in frontend is expected to be in JSON format , it can be very well stored in MONGO DB. The team was worried as to how to handle the JSON format data and idea to store it in MONGO DB resolved the problem. So it was decided that AMit, Pooja and Prathamesh will implement the REST APIs using node.js and use Mongo DB to store the data .From frontend we will decided to use the GET/POST API to pull/push the card details, payment details, order details etc into the Mongo DB

# Courage 4 : 05/07/2019
During the team meeting, Prathamesh suggested that we start with creating the wireframes for the android mobile app. Nihal put forth the idea of starting the design of the mobile application frontend. Amit and Pooja gave ideas on how to host the server application on AWS.

# Courage 5 : 05/08/2019
The team reported on the progress of the individual API's. Pooja was facing issues in the Add Cards API where the API was not working when the user tried to insert the same card again. Jessica mentioned that she created APIs for payment enablement and Amit mentioned that he is working on deploying the apk file on AWS cloud. This really helped them to resolve the issue. 

# Courage 6 : 05/09/2019
Issues and bug fixing reporting: Each API owner worked on their part and discussed on open issues and bugs. For example: Reported  bug of multiple entries for the same userid were allowed  by the first alogorithm. Even after a lot of effort, it was not getting resolved . So we all worked together to  get it resolved. This team  effort worked really well to keep the team motivated.

# Courage 7 : 05/10/2019
Issue and bug fixing continued: Reported bugs are resolved by each API owner and we worked by sitting in college to support each other.
Integration of distinct API is also done before hand to ensure smooth deliverables. To ensure no late minute activities, We also decided on demo part and integration of documents in github.
