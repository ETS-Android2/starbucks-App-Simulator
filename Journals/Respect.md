# Communication 1 : 05/04/2019
Since constant communication is the key to any successful project, all the team members decided to meet in college to put together our thoughts about the group project. We went through the group project requirements and decided that we would be implementing 5 APIs as a part of the individual portion, and for extra credits we would create an android app and deploy API to AWS in an Auto Scaled EC2 Cluster with Load Balancer for extra credit




# Communication 2 : 05/05/2019
We had a conference call where Nihal suggesetd that we  could implement the REST APIs and demo the components through an android mobile app. Since Nihal was comfortable with java development on android, the team agrees to this suggestion. The team decided that they would collaborate with Nihal for their individual API's and Nihal would intergrate them into the android mobile app



# Communication 3 : 05/06/2019
During the daily call on 05/06/, Jessica and Nihal suggested that the REST APIs be implemented using PHP. Amit, Pooja and Prathamesh said that since they had worked on node js and react js, they were comfortable implementing the REST APIs on react js using postman. So it was decided that AMit, Pooja and Prathamesh will implement the REST APIs using react.js and use a POST API to push the card details, payment details, order details etc into the Mongo DB
